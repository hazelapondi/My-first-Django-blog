'''
As you can see, we're now assigning a view called post_list to the ^$ URL. 
This regular expression will match ^ (a beginning) followed by $ (an end) â€“ 
so only an empty string will match. That's correct, because in Django URL resolvers, 
'http://127.0.0.1:8000/' is not a part of the URL. 
This pattern will tell Django that views.post_list is the right place to go if someone enters your website 
at the 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/' address.

The last part, name='post_list', is the name of the URL that will be used to identify the view.
This can be the same as the name of the view but it can also be something completely different. 
We will be using the named URLs later in the project, so it is important to name each URL in the app. 
We should also try to keep the names of URLs unique and easy to remember.
