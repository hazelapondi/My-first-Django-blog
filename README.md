# Build a blog from scratch with Django Girls Tutorials
I built this blog using the Django Girls Tutorials. Couldn't stop once I started.
They break down things so clearly and at the end you deploy your app on pythonanywhere.com
P.S Technically this is not my first blog, but for what it's worth, my first time working with django.
